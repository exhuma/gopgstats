// This file contains the needed queries for the database. It is in very close
// relation to `types.go` which defines a struct for each row related to these
// queries. If the structure of a query changes, the corresponding struct must
// also be adapted in `types.go`
//
// In order to accomodate changes in tables structures across PostgreSQL
// versions ,these queries are defined with the help of the "VersionedQuery"
// type. This takes two values. The Minimum version since when the query was
// available and the actual query. Each query in a group *must* have the same
// structure/schema!
//
// The version comparison is done using the `server_version_num` value from
// PostgreSQL, which is a simple numerical value.
//
// A query which is the same across all versions can simply define a minimal
// version of `0`.
