PostgreSQL statistics for Go
============================


This package contains helper functions to retrieve runtime statistcs of a
PostgreSQL DB server.


This Package is NOT FIT FOR USE yet!
------------------------------------

I have started this project in order to migrate my existing munin plugins for
PostgreSQL to telegraf & influxdb.

I have not yet written any consequential work in Go, so the project structure
may not adhere to well-established standards for Go packages. The same goes
for the source-code.

Consider this as an active playground.
